## About Krisp
Krisp is a revolutionary AI-powered noise cancellation application that transforms any environment into a professional recording studio by removing background noise, echo, and other audio disturbances in real-time. Using advanced neural network technology, Krisp operates locally on your device to ensure privacy while delivering studio-quality audio for calls, recordings, and streaming. Available for both Windows and macOS, this intelligent software works with any communication application including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, Skype, and hundreds more, making it an essential tool for remote workers, content creators, podcasters, and anyone who participates in online meetings from less-than-ideal acoustic environments.

The software stands out with its proprietary AI technology that has been trained on thousands of hours of audio data to distinguish human speech from background noise with remarkable accuracy. Unlike traditional noise suppression methods that can degrade voice quality, Krisp's neural networks preserve the natural characteristics of your voice while eliminating unwanted sounds like keyboard typing, dog barking, construction noise, or cafe chatter. The application also features echo cancellation that prevents audio feedback during speakerphone use and can even remove background noise from other participants on your calls. With additional features like meeting transcription, analytics, and voice productivity metrics, Krisp goes beyond simple noise cancellation to become a comprehensive voice productivity platform that enhances communication clarity and professionalism across all your digital interactions.
